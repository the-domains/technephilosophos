χαῖρε, κόσμε. That's the traditional way for a neophyte to begin working in a tech space, yes? It seemed appropriate for trying out The Grid.

I did give some thought to finding a good Greek translation of The Grid, but the closest a cursory search could produce (without the risk to life and limb posed by possibly dropping my big Liddell on my foot) was [τυρόκνηστις][0]. And somehow "cheese grater" doesn't quite cut it.

Anyway, I've done the blog thing before. But long-term maintenance of such a project ἐμέ ἔλαθε.
