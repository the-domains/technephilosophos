The new semester nears...

...and I'm experiencing the usual swirl of worries, mostly framed in the context of a sense of responsibility. I'm teaching 100% new first-year students this term - I'm not just introducing them to my academic discipline, but to the **culture** of college. Habits, skills, expectations: this layer over and above the usual "here's what to read, here's what to write".

I continue to think that higher education is a worthy and worthwhile (both!) pursuit. In a cultural and political climate in which that's [less a universal value][0] than it once was, though, I see a growing need for people to be more active in **demonstrating** such value as they believe is there. For me, that's another layer of responsibility to feel pressure about. :-/

I really want, more than anything, to show incoming students what education **means, **in the deepest sense:

\*\* becoming a person who sees this whole crazy complex world as a vast series of opportunities, fascinating journeys to take, curious phenomena to explore;

\*\* and, becoming a person with the justified confidence in their own skills to make the changes they want to happen, in their own lives and in the world at large.

That's a tall order.
