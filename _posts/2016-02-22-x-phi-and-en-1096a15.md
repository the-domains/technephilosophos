This weekend, a philosophy colleague included me in an email conversation about a piece by Vlad Chituc and Paul Henne in the _New York Times_ Gray Matter opinion column, "The Data Against Kant". [Go read it,][0] but the gist is that recent experimental research seems to bear against a longstanding ethical presumption.

Most of the responses in the email conversation were dismissive of the research. I knew that my colleagues were firmly in the analytic tradition of philosophy; still, I was a bit dismayed at the ease with which several of them, whose professional values I've always respected, seemed ready to judge the value of the research before even reading it (it's not being published 'til May). This post is my attempt to articulate why experimental philosophy ("x-phi") collaborations with the sciences matter, in a way that my more mainstream philosophy colleagues aren't quite recognizing yet.

> "Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the subject-matter admits of; for precision is not to be sought for alike in all discussion, any more than in all the products of the crafts. ...\[I\]t is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits". **Aristotle, _EN_ I.3 1094b12-22**

Yeah, I've been spending too much time reading the ancients, as usual.

The first interesting thing about the study, to me, is just noting that ethics is necessarily about the actual choices and actions of moral agents living real lives. ([Thanks, Socrates!][1]) To that extent, I'd consider it a danger to dismiss empirical observations of human choice-making as mere confusions. The analytic emphasis on logical relations of sentences risks tending toward the self-referential, and it takes diligence to avoid falling into that vortex. (Gaunilo's island, anyone?) When rigorous conceptual analysis is challenged by rigorous empirical observation, I'm not immediately inclined to dismiss the latter and favor the former. (I am, of course, here [charitably presuming][2] appropriate rigor, as I've not seen the study yet.)

I've seen no one claiming that these data disprove anything; reading the piece closely, I see Chituc and Henne being careful and modest: "We think...", "evidence suggesting...", "we found no relationship...", "this one study alone doesn't refute Kant...". I guess I'm missing why we should dismiss this work out of hand; unless it's that we don't want to consider that we might be mistaken. I don't think that responsiveness to empirical observation necessarily entails relativism. And unless we are committed to the existence of ethical principles unresponsive to empirical proof or disproof, I think such studies have bearing.

I understand the need for foundational principles; this particular claim may not necessarily be one of them. If we are starting to find evidence for claims we once had to take as axiomatic, I think that's OK.

Taking a look at the context and content of what's presented:

The traditional "ought implies can" mantra can be expressed as follows:

* IF (action A is morally obligatory for person P), THEN (A is possible for P).
* IF (A is not possible for P), THEN (A is not morally obligatory for P).

Instead of the above, the study suggests that individuals use a more complex set of relations when making moral judgments, to wit:

* IF (A is not possible for P) AND (P acted so that A is not possible for P), THEN (A is morally obligatory for P).

or

* IF (A is not possible for P) AND (P did not intentionally cause A to be possible for P), THEN (A is not morally obligatory for P).

I would argue that this more complex articulation is similar to how we understand the moral obligations of persons who are drunk or otherwise incapacitated by their own previous choice. Rather than simply stating

* IF (action A is not possible for drunk person D), THEN (A is not morally obligatory for D).

We do (rightly, I think) say rather

* IF (A is not possible for D) AND (D acted so that A is not possible for D), THEN (A is \[still\] morally obligatory for D).

Let's articulate this in more concrete terms. Which of the following seems more appropriate as a principle to guide moral evaluation?

* If driving safely is not possible for a drunk person, then driving safely is not morally obligatory for the drunk person.

or

* If driving safely is not possible for a drunk person, and the drunk person acted so that driving safely is not possible for him, then driving safely is \[still\] morally obligatory for the drunk person.

I have a suspicion that this conversation will continue (we're all philosophers, after all...). I'll share more as it happens.
