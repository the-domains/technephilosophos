**Beta** is fun!

**To** be fair, I've always thought that other letters had more pizzazz. Psi, for example. In general, most of the 'double' and/or aspirated consonants (phi, chi, theta) hold a certain allure.

**Still **and all, though, beta has its own charm. Especially in the software world. This is relevant, of course, since The Grid is...well, I'm not certain it's officially beta (it's in production, sorta, after all), but it's certainly got beta characteristics. Like occasional weirdnesses about posting stuff.

**This** post serves a purpose: it exists to potentially nudge my first post into existence. I have no idea whether this is likely to work, but experimentation is, like beta, fun.
